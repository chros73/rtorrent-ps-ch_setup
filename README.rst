Automated rTorrent-PS-CH configuration
===================================

An almost completely automated setup with `rTorrent-PS-CH <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps-ch/#fork-notes>`_ that doesn't need any additional UI only an SSH client (with the help of ``tmux``), with category support, requiring the least amount of human interaction, including config files/scripts/instrucions for FTP, Samba, email reporting and many more.
